        interestingly, 'readonly' doesn't apply to radio buttons.
        so we set 'pointer-events: none' to prevent clicking a radio.
        (it can also be done through JS but doesn't hurt to have this extra measure)
        (note: radio buttons can also be changed using the keyboard)

        note: we don't set 'disabled' because disabled inputs don't get
        submitted by the form, and therefore the server would complain that the form is missing.
